        <h2>Contact Us </h2>

<p>If you are interest in joining our lab, please start by reading my <a href="mentorship.html">Mentorship Philosophy</a> to determine whether LOGIC may be a good fit for you.  </p><br>

<p>Please contact <a href="mailto:vyas@cmu.edu">Saurabh</a> with the relevant information described below. </p><br>

<h1>Postdoctoral Scholars</h1><br>

<p>If you are within ~12 months of defending your PhD and interested in exploring a postdoc position within LOGIC, please contact Saurabh with a brief email (4-5 sentences) describing your current research topic, and what you would like to investigate during your postdoc. Please include a copy of your CV. </p><br>

<p>We are particularly interested in scientists with prior experience in NHP (neuro)physiology, network modeling, and/or high-dimensional data analysis. However, if you are excited about our research and willing to learn some (many?) new things, Saurabh will be excited to chat with you. 
</p><br>

<h1>Doctoral (or Master's) Students</h1><br>

<p>If you are an undergraduate currently applying to graduate school and curious whether I will be taking on new PhD students, then the answer is yes. I can advise any student at CMU or Pitt (e.g., you can apply to the programs in <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/ni/academics/grad/programs/phd-neural-computation">Neural Computation</a>, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/ni/academics/grad/programs/phd-systems-neuroscience">Systems Neuroscience</a>, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/bme/Academics/graduate-programs/phd_program.html">Biomedical Engineering</a>, etc.).  </p><br>

<p>We are particularly interested in scientists with prior experience in NHP (neuro)physiology, network modeling, and/or high-dimensional data analysis. However, if you are excited about our research and willing to learn some (many?) new things, Saurabh will be excited to chat with you. 
</p><br>

<h1>Research Staff</h1><br>

<p>We are currently looking for full-time laboratory technicians. This can include a very fun mix of animal work, hardware/software prototyping, and data science. We are open to recent graduates or postbacs looking to gain research experience before applying to graduate or professional schools. Our research is quite time-intensive. If you don't think you can commit at least ~2 years, this is likely not a good fit. Please reach out to Saurabh with a brief email (4-5 sentences max). Include a copy of your CV/resume, and a rough sense of how many years you plan to spend in this position. If this would be your first full-time position out of college, please also include a copy of your transcript. I'm not really judging your grades, I just want to get a sense for the kind of classes you've taken.  </p><br>

<h1>Undergraduates</h1><br>

<p>If you are currently an undergraduate at CMU, Pitt, or any other University, and looking for opportunities to gain hands-on research experience, either during the summer, or during the school year, please reach out to Saurabh with a brief email (2-3 sentences max). Include a copy of your most recent transcript, a CV/resume, and a rough sense of how many hours you think you can spend in the lab each week. </p><br>
