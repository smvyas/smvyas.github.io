            <p class="bio">Saurabh Vyas completed undergraduate training in Biomedical Engineering and Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a> in 2012. While working on his MSE in Biomedical Engineering, Saurabh was a research engineer at the <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/">Applied Physics Laboratory</a>. Saurabh completed his PhD in Bioengineering at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> in 2020, where he was advised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_Shenoy">Prof. Krishna Shenoy</a>. His research was recognized with a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and a NIH NINDS NRSA (F31) fellowship. In 2021, Saurabh's thesis was awarded the <a href="https://grassfoundation.org/people/saurabh-vyas/">Donald B. Lindsley Prize</a> by the Society for Neuroscience, which <i>"recognizes a young neuroscientist's outstanding PhD thesis in the general area of behavioral (i.e., systems) neuroscience."</i> Saurabh completed a postdoctoral fellowship at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> in 2025, where he was co-advised by <a href="https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/mark-m-churchland-phd">Profs. Mark Churchland</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shadlen">Michael Shadlen</a>. Saurabh's work was recognized by both an NIH NINDS Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (F32), and a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award. In January 2026, Saurabh joined the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/ni/">Neuroscience Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where he leads the Laboratory of General Intelligence and Computation (<a href="index.html">LOGIC</a>).</p>
